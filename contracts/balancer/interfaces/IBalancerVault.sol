     * If joining a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to send ETH directly: the Vault will do the wrapping. To enable
     * this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the

     * interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If sending ETH however, the array must be
     * sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final
     * `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be joined.
     *
     * If `fromInternalBalance` is true, the caller's Internal Balance will be preferred: ERC20 transfers will only
     * be made for the difference between the requested amount and Internal Balance (if any). Note that ETH cannot be
     * withdrawn from Internal Balance: attempting to do so will trigger a revert.
     *
     * This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onJoinPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement
     * their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number
     * of Pool shares). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and passed
     * directly to the Pool's contract, as is `recipient`.

    //  - General: no specialization, suited for all Pools. IGeneralPool is used for swap request callbacks, passing the
    // balance of all tokens in the Pool. These Pools have the largest swap costs (because of the extra storage reads),
    // which increase with the number of registered tokens.
    //
    //  - Minimal Swap Info: IMinimalSwapInfoPool is used instead of IGeneralPool, which saves gas by only passing the
    // balance of the two tokens involved in the swap. This is suitable for some pricing algorithms, like the weighted
    // constant product one popularized by Balancer V1. Swap costs are smaller compared to general Pools, and are
    // independent of the number of registered tokens.
    //
    //  - Two Token: only allows two tokens to be registered. This achieves the lowest possible swap gas cost. Like
    // minimal swap info Pools, these are called via IMinimalSwapInfoPool.
